# Relays, storage, and the deployment tool

Haven has **no central service**. What little infrastructure exists is federated,
swappable, hardened-by-default, and runnable by anyone. This doc defines the two
relay roles, the storage model, the IP-privacy guarantees (honestly), and the
multi-cloud deployment tool.

## Two relay roles — keep them separate

| | **Connection relay** | **Storage relay** ("mailbox") |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Forward live packets when two *online* peers can't NAT-punch directly | Hold an encrypted blob for an *offline* peer until pulled |
| Shape | Stateless running service (TURN/DERP-style, RAM-only) | Mostly **object storage** (S3/R2/B2/GCS) + a thin stateless broker |
| Sees | Ciphertext + the two IPs it bridges | Ciphertext + uploader/downloader requests |
| Best for | Real-time (calls, both-online transfers) | **Offline delivery + large/lossless files** |
| Cost | ~$5/mo VPS, or per-GB TURN | Storage + egress only; can be the user's *own* bucket |

A peer with no route at all falls through the chain from `ARCHITECTURE.md`:
**sender-online → group-gossip cache → storage relay (BYO or quota'd)**. The
connection relay is only for the live-but-NAT-blocked case.

## Redundancy & graceful fallback

A circle isn't limited to one relay. Each client keeps an **ordered set of relays per circle**
and degrades gracefully:

- **Redundancy (mirrored writes):** every post + sealed-media blob is `put` to *all* of the
  circle's relays (and the BYO S3 bucket). Keys are content-addressed, so re-puts are
  idempotent and the same envelope on N relays is harmless.
- **Fallback (fan-out reads):** the mailbox poll reads from *all* relays and dedups by the
  content key, so a message present on **any one reachable** relay still arrives. Media fetch
  tries each relay in turn and takes the first hit.
- **Health-aware skipping:** a relay that fails to connect/put/list is put into **exponential
  backoff** (5s → 5m cap) and skipped until it's due for a retry, so a dead relay never blocks
  the others; when it recovers it's picked up automatically.
- **Auto-pooling:** when a circle member advertises their relay (frame 19 / `RELAY_NODE`),
  peers **add** it to their set rather than replacing — so adopting one relay each gives the
  whole circle several, with no manual fan-out.
- **Layered delivery:** relays are one tier of the chain above — if every relay is down, direct
  P2P (online peers) and the BYO S3 bucket still carry traffic.

Adopt several relays (one hosted on your always-on box, one on a friend's, a community one) and
the circle keeps working through any single failure. The desktop client surfaces each relay's
reachability (● online / retrying) with add/remove in **Relay**; per-relay backoff is
unit-tested (`relayhealth.rs`).

### Relay mesh — self-replicating mailboxes (implemented)

On top of the client-driven redundancy above, relays now **replicate among themselves** so
**any relay holds the whole circle mailbox**, a relay can **join and pull the full set** from
peers, and one can **leave with zero loss** because others already have copies. Clients then
only need to reach *one* relay. This is naturally a **CRDT set-union**: blobs are
content-addressed and sealed, so replication is idempotent and conflict-free — no node ever
sees content, only that a key exists.

It's a small, well-shaped change on top of the existing `haven/blob/1` store, because a relay
is **already both** a `BlobServer` (serves clients) and able to be a `BlobClient` (dial another
relay). The pieces:

1. **Peer set.** Each relay learns its sibling relays for the circle. Two sources: the relay
   `Config`/link gains an optional `peers: [node_hex]`, and — since a client already knows every
   relay it adopted — the client advertises the set to each relay (reuse the `RELAY_NODE`
   channel). Relays can also gossip newly-learned peers transitively.
2. **Anti-entropy loop.** Every ~30s each relay, for each reachable peer: `BlobClient.connect`
   → `list("haven/")` → diff against its local store (`has`) → `get` + write the missing blobs
   (and optionally push its own). Bidirectional pull ⇒ eventual consistency; the existing
   per-relay backoff handles a peer that's down.
3. **Join/leave = free.** A new relay starts empty, runs one anti-entropy pass, and is now a
   full replica. A leaving relay needs no handoff — the set already lives on its peers.
4. **Surfaces (shipped):** `core/haven-net/blobstore.rs` — `BlobServer::sync_pull_from(peer)`
   over the existing put/get/has/list, with a pure unit-tested `keys_to_pull` (set-difference +
   namespace-confinement) and a `MAX_SYNC_PULL` cap; `core/haven-relay` — `config.peers`
   (repeatable `--peer <hex>` flag or `"peers"` in the JSON config) + a 30s anti-entropy loop on
   the local-disk backend; `RelayServerHandle::sync_from` so the **in-app** relay meshes too —
   the desktop engine auto-syncs its hosted relay from every adopted sibling (health-aware, so a
   down peer is skipped). Every official client can be a full mesh node, not just the CLI.

**Security note (review before relying on it in production):** replication never widens content exposure —
adopting a relay already hands it the full (sealed) mailbox, so a peer relay holding the same
ciphertext is no new disclosure. The review items are (a) **amplification/DoS** — cap peer
fan-out, rate-limit `list`/`get`, and bound store size per circle; (b) **poisoning** — a peer
can only add content-addressed blobs (a bad key simply never matches a real ref and is inert,
but still counts against quota → needs a cap); (c) **membership authz** — only relays a circle
actually adopted should mesh (gossiped peers must trace back to a `RELAY_NODE` advertisement
sealed to the circle, not arbitrary node ids). This touches the security-audited core shared by
iOS/Android, so it lands as a reviewed, cross-platform change — not a desktop-only tweak.

## Storage model

> **Updated per DECISIONS D15 (zero operator cost).** Media lives on a **Haven relay
> mailbox** or the user's **own S3-compatible bucket**; there is **no operator-funded
> bucket** and therefore **no quota system, blind tokens, or storage subscription**.
> A relay is the user's own or a *voluntary, community-run* node, never something the
> operator must fund.

1. **Haven relay mailbox (default).** Sealed blobs park on a **Haven relay's local
   disk** — the in-app relay any official client can host, or the standalone
   `haven-relay` daemon. The relay is run by the user or a community volunteer, so it
   is $0 to the operator. Any client can pull from a relay mailbox, so it works
   cross-platform.
2. **BYO bucket.** Any user can point Haven at their own **S3-compatible bucket** (AWS
   S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, MinIO) — their storage, their cost. Also works for
   cross-platform offline delivery.

Blobs are E2E-encrypted and content-addressed (BLAKE3) before leaving the device, and
get a **lifecycle expiry** (auto-delete after N days) so nothing lingers.

**The broker (only for BYO-served buckets).** You can't hand arbitrary clients
raw bucket credentials, so a **thin, stateless broker** mints **scoped presigned
URLs** (PUT/GET for one content hash). It is small — but it is *the* component where
the no-log discipline must be absolute (see below). A Haven relay serves its own
mailbox directly, so the broker is only needed for the BYO-bucket path.

## IP privacy — what is and isn't guaranteed

**A relay or storage node transiently handles your IP — that is physically how bytes
reach you.** "No node ever sees your IP" is false for direct access and we will not
claim it. What we *do* guarantee, enforced by the deploy tool's default config:

- **Zero logging / zero persistence.** RAM-only operation, no access logs, no disk
  spill, provider-side request logging disabled where the provider allows it.
- **No identity ↔ IP linkage.** Peers authenticate **to each other** end-to-end,
  never to the relay. The relay/broker sees opaque sealed frames addressed by
  **ephemeral rendezvous tokens**, not Haven public keys. A node that somehow logged
  an IP still could not tie it to a Haven identity.
- **No operator-funded quota.** Storage is a Haven relay mailbox (the user's own or a
  volunteer's) or the user's own S3-compatible bucket, so there is no metered allotment
  to enforce (the earlier blind-signed quota-token model was deleted per D15).
- **Opt-in onion/proxy mode for true hiding (planned — not yet shipped; iroh is QUIC/UDP, which Tor's SOCKS can't carry, so this needs a TCP transport).** The only way a node genuinely cannot
  see your IP is to not connect to it directly. Haven ships an **optional** mode that
  routes relay + storage access through Tor or a user-chosen proxy. Off by default
  (latency cost); on for users who want full IP hiding.

Summary of the honest promise: **never logged, never linked to you, optionally fully
hidden.**

## The deployment tool (`haven-relay`)

Goal: anyone can stand up a compliant relay on any major cloud in one command, with
privacy-hardened defaults they can't accidentally turn off.

- **Artifact:** the relay is a single **static Rust binary** + a container image,
  no runtime dependencies.
- **IaC:** **OpenTofu** (open-source Terraform) modules, one per provider:
  **AWS, GCP, Azure, Hetzner, Fly.io, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare R2, Oracle (free
  tier), bare VPS/Docker.**
- **CLI:**
  ```sh
  haven-relay deploy --provider hetzner --role both       # connection + storage
  haven-relay deploy --provider cloudflare-r2 --role storage   # bucket + broker only
  haven-relay deploy --provider oracle --role connection       # free-tier TURN/DERP
  ```
  Each run: provisions the box and/or bucket, gets auto-TLS, applies the
  **hardened no-log config by default**, sets blob lifecycle expiry, and
  **self-registers to discovery** so clients can find and rank it.
- **Storage-only needs no compute** — a Tofu module that provisions just a bucket +
  scoped creds + auto-expiry + the broker. The cheapest possible relay.
- **Defaults are the product.** No-logging, RAM-only, and identity-blind rendezvous are
  *on by default and hard to disable*, so a casual operator can't accidentally run a
  surveilling relay.

## Status

**Implemented:** the relay itself ships in two forms — an **in-app RelayHost** (FFI,
runs in-process; the Mac runs it as an *invisible background relay* via accessory
activation policy) and a **standalone `haven-relay` daemon** (single static Rust binary;
`relay/` packages it for macOS launchd, Linux systemd, and Docker). It serves both roles
(connection relay + media store-and-forward) over Haven Net with no public host. The
storage mailbox also supports a **pre-signed-URL** model (`PresignStore`) so members never
hold bucket credentials.

**Still design-only:** the multi-cloud OpenTofu deploy modules (`haven-relay deploy
--provider …`) and self-registration to discovery.
