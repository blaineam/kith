> Every client links the *same* Rust core: Apple and Android through UniFFI (Swift /
> Kotlin), and the Windows/Linux Tauri app links it **directly** as a Rust crate (its
> backend is Rust, so no FFI hop). All run a real native iroh peer. The web client was

**Invariant:** everything above the transport seam deals only in hybrid-PQ
encrypted bytes. The transport is interchangeable; the crypto is transport-blind.

## The core (`core/p2pcore`)

| Module | Responsibility | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `identity` | On-device keypair (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65 + X25519 + ML-KEM-768); public `HavenId`; routable node id; tamper-check hash | ✅ implemented + tested |
| `crypto` | Hybrid-PQ KEM (X25519 + ML-KEM-768 → HKDF) and AES-256-GCM seal/open | ✅ implemented + tested |
| `link` | `haven://` and `https://` reach-me links/QR; parse, verify, MITM check | ✅ implemented + tested |
| `social` | Circles, posts, stories, comments, reactions, edit/unsend, DMs, media + music refs — events sealed E2E to all members (per-member hybrid-KEM wrap), hybrid-signed; `build_feed` reducer | ✅ implemented + tested |
| `transport` (`haven-net`) | iroh QUIC `Node` (listen/dial, sealed payloads); mesh-relay frames; S3-over-iroh tunnel | ✅ implemented + tested |
| `groups` (MLS) | Harden the multi-recipient PKE layer to `mls-rs` with a hybrid-PQ ciphersuite (forward secrecy / efficient membership) | ⏳ planned |
| `discovery` | Resolve a node id to a live address (iroh n0 today; signed DHT records later) | 🟡 iroh discovery in use |
| `blobs` | Content-addressed (BLAKE3) chunked media transfer (512 KB sealed chunks) | ✅ implemented |
| FFI | UniFFI → Swift (Apple) + Kotlin (Android) | ✅ implemented |

## How a photo gets from A to B (target flow)

> **Today vs. target:** the implemented engine seals each event with a fresh content key
> wrapped per-member via the hybrid KEM (multi-recipient PKE), *not* yet MLS. The MLS
> hardening (forward secrecy / efficient membership) is planned; the flow below reads
> "group/MLS" as the target shape.

1. **A** has **B**'s `HavenId` (from a prior QR/link approval). A is a member of the
   shared circle (group) with B.
2. A optionally **auto-optimizes** the media (HEVC/HEIF/AAC) or sends the original
   losslessly if chosen. The file is chunked and content-addressed (BLAKE3).
3. A derives a content key for B's group via MLS, **seals** the chunks (AES-256-GCM
   under a hybrid-PQ-derived key), and addresses them to B's node id.
4. The **path-selector** picks the route: Bluetooth if nearby and small; local WiFi
   for bulk; relay only if nothing local is reachable. Discovery resolves B's
   current address from the DHT by B's node id.
5. **B** pulls/receives the sealed chunks over whatever path won, verifies each
   chunk hash, decrypts, and (if B was offline) the chunks were held by the fallback
   chain: sender-online → group-gossip cache → B's own storage pin.

## The offline-delivery fallback chain

Because there's no central store, large content for an offline peer falls through:

1. **Sender stays online** — direct, zero cost.
2. **Group-gossip cache** — other online group members opportunistically cache &
   forward the *encrypted* chunks for the offline member.
3. **Relay mailbox / BYO storage pin** — encrypted blobs park on a **Haven relay
   mailbox** (the in-app relay or the `haven-relay` daemon) or the recipient's *own*
   **S3-compatible bucket** (S3/R2/B2/MinIO) until pulled.

## Clients

- **Apple (iOS + macOS):** SwiftUI on the Rust core via UniFFI. Full transport ladder
  (nearby MultipeerConnectivity + iroh + relay), Keychain key storage, MusicKit,
  WebRTC calls, on-device `SensitiveContentAnalysis`. macOS ships today via **Mac
  Catalyst**; a **native AppKit/SwiftUI port is in progress** (see
  [`MACOS-NATIVE-PORT.md`](MACOS-NATIVE-PORT.md)).
- **Android (native, in progress):** Jetpack Compose + the *same* Rust core via UniFFI
  Kotlin bindings — a real iroh peer, not a browser. Android Keystore for keys. The web
  client was abandoned (browsers can't be iroh peers); `web/` is now an invite-landing
  page only.
- **Windows / Linux (Tauri 2, in progress):** a WebView2/WebKit frontend over a **Rust**
  backend that links the core **directly** (`haven_ffi` as a crate — no UniFFI hop, since
  the process is itself Rust). The iroh peer runs natively, so this is a real peer, not a
  thin web client. Keys live in the OS secure store (Credential Manager / Secret Service)
  via `keyring`. The *same binary* runs headless as the circle relay/mailbox
  (`--headless`), like the invisible Mac relay. See [`WINDOWS-PORT.md`](WINDOWS-PORT.md).

## Relays (`relay/`)

Two roles, both federated, swappable, and runnable by anyone — never a central
service. Full detail in [`RELAY-AND-DEPLOY.md`](RELAY-AND-DEPLOY.md).

- **Connection relay** — a stateless dumb pipe that forwards encrypted QUIC/WebRTC
  traffic between live peers that can't NAT-punch directly. Never decrypts or stores.
- **Storage relay ("mailbox")** — mostly object storage (S3/R2/B2/GCS) + a thin
  broker, holding E2E-encrypted blobs for offline peers (rung 3 of the fallback
  chain). This is the BYO / quota'd-bucket model — the user's own storage, or any
  community member's, never required to be yours.

Both run with **hardened, no-log, identity-blind defaults**; IPs are never logged or
linked to identities, with a planned (not-yet-shipped) opt-in onion mode for full IP hiding. A
**`haven-relay`** deployment tool stands either role up on most clouds in one command.
