/// real content is NOT in the visible payload — the relay only ever forwards the field `e`,
/// a base64 blob that was sealed (hybrid post-quantum) to *us* by the sender. iOS hands the
/// push to this extension first; we read our master seed from the shared Keychain, decrypt
/// `e` with `openSealedWithSeed`, and rewrite the alert so the banner shows the real sender
/// and message. The relay never sees plaintext, and decryption happens on-device even on the
/// lock screen.
///
/// Everything is best-effort: if the seed is unavailable, the blob is missing/malformed, or
/// it wasn't sealed to us, we fall back to the generic banner the relay supplied. We never
/// fail the push.
