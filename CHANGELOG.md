# Changelog

All notable changes to Haven are recorded here. Haven is in **alpha**; entries are grouped
by dated waves (a batch of work committed together and rolled into the next build). See
[`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md) for the live build/shipping status and
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for milestones.

Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased] — 2026-07-02

Media-transport wave: the Haven relay gains a plain-HTTP interface as the DEFAULT cross-NAT media
path; S3 stays as the rarely-needed BYO-bucket option (iOS/macOS, Android, desktop, `haven-relay`).

### Added
- **Relay HTTP media interface — the default cross-NAT media transport.** The in-app relay host
  (and the standalone `haven-relay` daemon) now serves its blob store over ordinary HTTP/1.1
  (`core/haven-net/src/httprelay.rs`), alongside the iroh blob ALPN. Because plain HTTP traverses
  any NAT the moment the host is reachable, this is what makes cross-NAT media (videos, large
  photos) actually land — the iroh blob ALPN drops its datagrams over a pure-relay cross-NAT path
  (noq/iroh fork bug). Blobs are E2E-sealed before they hit the wire, so the interface carries only
  ciphertext; it's **bearer-token gated** (one token per relay, generated once and persisted), and
  the token is distributed to circle members ONLY inside the *sealed* frame-19 relay announce.
  `self/…` self-sync slots are never served over HTTP (they stay on the identity-verified iroh
  path). The host advertises its reachable URLs (LAN IPv4s + an optional operator-set public URL
  for port-forward / reverse-proxy / tunnel setups) in the announce; members fetch + upload media
  over HTTP first and fall back to the iroh blob dial only when no HTTP URL is reachable.
  `haven-relay` flags: `--http <bind>` (default `0.0.0.0:8674`), `--http-url <url>`, `--no-http`.
- **S3/HTTP bucket is now an opt-in BYO option, not the default.** A user-configured S3 bucket is
  still supported and still tried before the iroh blob dial, but the relay's own HTTP interface is
  the zero-config default so most users never touch S3.

### Fixed
- **Android launch crash (OOM) on a large synced video.** Once cross-NAT sync started delivering
  big videos, the feed's `MediaImage` thumbnail read the *entire* decrypted file into a `ByteArray`
  for **every** media ref — including videos — so a ~423 MB video blew the Nokia's ~512 MB heap the
  instant the feed rendered, crashing the app on launch. Fixed: `MediaImage` now decodes IMAGES
  downsampled and renders a VIDEO poster frame via `MediaMetadataRetriever` (never decoding a video
  as a bitmap), and `LocalMedia` skips any media too large to decrypt in RAM on this device
  (`maxInMemoryBytes` guard) rather than OOM-crashing — it still lives sealed on disk + on the relay
  and plays on a higher-memory device.
- **Cross-NAT media sync (videos) now lands.** The iroh **blob** ALPN (`haven/blob/1`) drops its
  outbound datagrams over a pure-relay cross-NAT path (noq/iroh 1.0 fork bug, proven by two-sided
  connection traces) — so posts synced but videos/large photos timed out forever. Media upload +
  fetch now try the relay's **HTTP interface first**, then a configured S3 bucket, and the iroh blob
  dial last (as an opportunistic fast-path / the only path when nothing else is configured), on all
  platforms. Apple also stops gating the bucket leg on "no relays configured", and Apple + desktop
  skip un-dialable `s3:` pseudo relay entries in the dial loops. A reachable HTTP relay that answers
  404 for a key is treated as a real MISS (the iroh path serves the same store), so we don't waste a
  ~30 s doomed dial on it. See `docs/BYO-STORAGE.md` → "Media transport order".

## [2026-06-30]

Multi-device and Messages wave (iOS/iPadOS, macOS, Android, and desktop, all sharing the Rust core).

### Fixed
- **Own-device sync now converges.** The epoch group-keying overhaul left each device minting a
  *random* epoch key per circle, so a user's own devices (iPhone/iPad/Mac) could never open each
  other's events — posts and DMs never synced across devices. Fixed with **own-device epoch-key
  convergence**: when a device receives a key commit it authored itself, both devices deterministically
  adopt the numerically-larger epoch key + circle secret, so buffered events drain and future re-seals
  use the agreed key (`core/p2pcore-ffi/src/lib.rs` `receive_key_commit`). Consistent across iOS/macOS,
  Android (shared `.so`), and desktop (links the crate directly).
- **DM-delete no longer restores old messages.** Deleting a conversation records a local "cleared
  before" **watermark** so re-starting the DM doesn't surface previously-deleted messages that a peer
  (or your other device) still holds. True network deletion is impossible in P2P — the watermark is a
  local clear, documented as such.
- **Missing media settles.** A **media-request throttle** stops absent media from being re-requested
  forever; the per-contact history re-send (the actual flood) is throttled to an occasional cadence.

### Added
- **Per-device transport identity.** Each client instance takes its own per-device transport/relay id
  (so any number of a user's devices can run under one account without colliding on iroh discovery),
  while the account seed stays the identity — the trust anchor and roster signer — never a transport
  address.
- **Messages: recency sorting + conversation pinning.** Conversations sort by most-recent activity;
  pin up to 6 (iMessage-style), with drag-to-rearrange on iOS/macOS. Pins **self-sync across your
  devices** via the account-state CRDT.
- **Group DMs: per-message metadata.** Each incoming message shows the sender's display name, a
  timestamp, and a delivery checkmark.

### Changed
- **Scroll / perf pass.** Image and video-poster decoding moved off the main thread and hot-path
  logging removed from scroll, for smoother feed and message-list scrolling.
- **Android + desktop parity.** The DM delete-watermark, group-DM sender/timestamp/checkmark rows,
  and pinned + recency-sorted messages were ported to the native Android client and the Tauri desktop
  client, alongside the shared own-device sync fix.

### Docs
- Swept README, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/MULTI-DEVICE.md`, `docs/GROUP-KEYING.md`,
  `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ANDROID-PARITY.md`, `docs/MEDIA-AND-MUSIC.md`, and `docs/DECISIONS.md` to
  match current reality: macOS ships from the **native `HavenMac`** target (Mac Catalyst dropped
  2026-06-23), group keying (epoch sender-keys) + self-sync are shipped, own-device sync converges,
  and Android now has media chunks, WebRTC calls, notifications, nearby, and the DM parity wave.
